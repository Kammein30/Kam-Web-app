                            <b>Youtube : </b> When I'm on youtube I enjoy two channels over the others; What If and
                            CinemaSins (covered
                            in the movie section). What if
                            is a channel that, through scientific research, makes hypothesis/factual videos about what
                            if something
                            happens in life (i.e. what if the sahara desert was covered in solar panels, what if spiders
                            were the size
                            of humans, what if we turned plastic into fuel, what if you were made of dark matter, etc.)
                            What if helps me
                            gain new knowledge that I wouldn't have had prior and also helps answer some of my curiosity
                            about if
                            certain events happened in life. Other than What If videos, I usually enjoy watching coding
                            videos that help
                            me learn new techniques in coding and also exposes me to different languages I haven't
                            learned yet.

                            <b>Movies/TV shows : </b> I began this section making assertive statements, Dark Knight is
                            the best movie of
                            all time and Breaking Bad is the best TV show of all time. With this out the way, I am
                            addicted to movies
                            and tv shows, particularly ones about superheroes or anything else science fiction. I hate
                            eating without
                            having something to watch and I will wait til I find something of interest to watch before I
                            eat. I also
                            enjoy watching cinemasins, which is a channel on Youtube dedicated to comedically pointing
                            out movie flaws.
                            Watching movies, shows, and also cinemasins is just another way I de-stress from school and
                            basketball.
