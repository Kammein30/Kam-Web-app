                            <b>Data Structures :</b> This course covered the organization of data and the algorithms
                            that act upon them.
                            The
                            topics of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, and hash tables were introduced.
                            Fundamentals of
                            algorithm performance are also introduced, with an emphasis placed on time complexity
                            analysis. Projects
                            included implementation of data structures as well as the application of data structures
                            from
                            standard libraries.

                            <b> Network Protocols :</b> Projects in this class were done in the Python programming
                            language. This class
                            provided
                            an introduction to the principles and practice of computer
                            networking with emphasis on the Internet and related protocols, including HTTP, FTP, POP,
                            IMAP, SMTP, DNS,
                            UDP, and TCP/IP with a focus on the application, transport and network layers. The course
                            also introduces
                            the structure, components, and functionality of network architectures including packet
                            switching, error
                            control, flow control, and congestion control.

                            building, continuous integration, and revision management. Projects provided an opportunity
                            to develop an
                            understanding of these tools and how they are used in actual practice and as a result, all
                            projects were
                            group based.

                            <b>Computer Organization : </b> This class provided an introduction to the structure of
                            computer hardware,
                            including the components of a modern computer system as well as the tradeoffs necessary to
                            construct such a
                            system. Specific topics include Boolean Algebra, basic combinatorial logic, basic sequential
                            logic, numeric
                            systems, the role of performance in designing computer systems, Amdahl’s Law, instruction
                            formats,
                            addressing modes, computer arithmetic with both fixed and floating point numbers, single
                            cycle and
                            multi-cycle data-path design, pipelining, the memory hierarchy, and caching. Assembly
                            programs were
                            developed on a simulator as a means of exploring instruction formats and data-path
                            operation.

                            <b>Software Component Design : </b> This class deals with the design and implementation of
                            software
                            subsystems. The concept of design patterns is introduced, and common patterns are applied to
                            the development
                            of software components. Projects provided an opportunity to implement components and to
                            integrate them into
                            complete systems. As a final assignment, small teams were created to conduct to implement
                            components and to
                            integrate them into complete systems.

                        <li><b>Discrete Math :</b> This class was an introduction to discrete mathematics as it applies
                            to computer
                            science. Topics include sets, logic, relations, functions, recursion, Boolean algebra, and
                            graph theory. A
                            couple of outcomes from this class include: demonstrating knowledge of formal logic proofs
                            and logical
                            reasoning through solving problems, applying logic to determine the validity of a formal
                            argument, and
                            constructing minimum spanning trees and adjacency matrices for graphs.

                            <b>Organizational Behavior and Leadership :</b> This class explores the challenges in
                            organizations in terms
                            of the interaction between human beings,
                            groups, and the organizational contexts within which they work. The class combines the
                            multidiscipline
                            approaches of psychology, sociology, anthropology, and management to understand, predict,
                            and manage
                            behavior in organizations. The primary goal of this course was to understand the ways
                            individuals, groups,
                            organizational structures, and culture impact an organization’s effectiveness and how an
                            organization
                            impacts all of those concepts in return. Specific attention was given to organizational
                            behaviors,
                            individual differences, employee fit, foundations of group behavior, communication, power
                            and politics,
                            culture, and change management.
